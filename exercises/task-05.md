# **TASK-05** / Build visualisations

## Context

The CTI and AI team needs to know more about the data contained in the Datawarehouse. They would like to know:
- the number of tags per tag type
- the number of analyses inserted each month
- the distribution of the malicious and non-malicious analyses per analyzer (defined in [**TASK-01**](./task-01.md))
- the distribution of families accross malwares (defined in [**TASK-03**](./task-03.md))


## Action

Make it simple for the users to explore the data present in the datawarehouse and to visualize these informations.


## Tips

1) This task may be done without having completed all previous tasks
2) The target of this task is to evaluate the exploration and visualisation processes and tools you setup rather than the plots themselves
