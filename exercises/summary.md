# Exercices

## Goal

Here's the list of tasks to be completed.

You can submit your answers in the way that suits you best:
* By making a new private github repository and adding [HugoMichard](https://github.com/HugoMichard) and [goncalogiga](https://github.com/goncalogiga) as contributors (preferred)
* By sending a ZIP file with your code
* ...Or any other method you prefer!

⚠️ If you choose to share your answers using a github repository, don't forget to make it private !

### Evaluation

- The tasks will all be ran using 500,000,000 rows (you do not have to use that many rows during your development work however). The scalability of the solution you provide will be the main evaluation point !
- You will be evaluated on the speed at which the desired information can be retrieved by the users (AI and CTI team)
- You will not be evaluated on the preprocessing time (if any) of your pipeline. You can work under the assumption that the information of the last week is not crucial for the users and that your solution would be ran only once a week
- The packaging of your solution and the simplicity of deploying it will be taken into account 
- You do not need to complete all tasks. If you run out of time, you can provide us with a precise description of how you would solve some of them and we will evaluate you based on it


## Method

You can freely use any free tools and method you want. You can update the database schema if needed, migrate the data to other databases, setup and build (or not) ETL pipelines.

ℹ️ We expect to be able to deploy the system you setup on our end as well as to test your solution. Don't forget some packaging and documentation !

⚠️ You can only use free tools and solutions
